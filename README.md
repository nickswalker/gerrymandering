How easy is it to swing an election? This little app demonstrates, letting the user try their hand at setting the districts for a small grid. All of the districts must be contiguous and of equal size. Once all tiles are grouped, the app will tell you who won the election.

This was a final project for my AP Computer Science class (13-14, Taft/Communications Arts).
